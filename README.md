# Ray Tracing Fundamentals

This repository contains my implementation of the ray tracer described in Peter Shirley's book [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
. I've worked through the book chapter by chapter, with each directory within this repo containing the code as it stood by the end of that chapter.

## Project Structure

The code is organized into chapter-specific directories, mirroring the progressive development of the ray tracer within the book:

- `chapter2`: Output an Image 
- `chapter3`: The vec3 Class
- `chapter4`: Rays, a Simple Camera, and Background
- `chapter5`: Adding a Sphere
- `chapter6`: Surface Normals and Multiple Objects
- `chapter7`: Moving Camera Code 
- `chapter8`: Antialiasing
- `chapter9`: Diffuse Materials
- `chapter10`: Metal
- `chapter11`: Dielectrics
- `chapter12`: Positionable Camera 
- `chapter13`: Defocus Blur
- `chapter14`: A Final Render (Where Next?) 

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, demonstrating various ray tracing concepts and techniques.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Peter Shirley for creating this fantastic resource and making it freely available. The step-by-step approach made learning ray tracing both accessible and enjoyable.
